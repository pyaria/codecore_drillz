/admin/user/new => every field is optional?

/users (erroneous sign in) => error.
Also weird space showing up.

@hong - admin makes a drill_group. Admin makes drills within drill_group. Admin then makes answers for drill.
page: drill name, drill name, drill description. create answer box. All answers. Try answering this drill!
^ can you clean up page please so that it looks better for the admin?

answer_id field in Drill model not necessary.

telling me that "this is not the point" is very dismissive when I am responding to you.
interrupting me when I'm talking is demeaning and disrespectful.
