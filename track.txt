/admin/user/new => every field is optional?

/users (erroneous sign in) => error.
Also weird space showing up.

@hong - admin makes a drill_group. Admin makes drills within drill_group. Admin then makes answers for drill.
page: drill name, drill name, drill description. create answer box. All answers. Try answering this drill!
^ can you clean up page please so that it looks better for the admin?


tl;dr: stop server, RUN BUNDLE INSTALL


added seed for categories

....
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require jquery-ui
....

categories_controller and routes updated

adding drill is now possible for general users... fix. admin only.

if adding drill fixed, slack Ana.
if categorization success, ana.


telling me that "this is not the point" is very dismissive when I am responding to you.
interrupting me when I'm talking is demeaning and disrespectful.
